This repo is an attempt to load an example
[`wtml`](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d4wwt/D4/testout.wtml) file with
the WWT HTML5 client library and is in a broken state.  The fancy WWT webclient
at http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/webclient/ is able to open the `wtml` so
it's likely that either the usage of the API is incorrect or there are
referring URL restrictions in the opaque WWT backend services.
